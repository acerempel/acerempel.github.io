      For what is a biga, see the recipe! It is a very delicious and thoroughly fermented
      bread that takes a long time and a lot of kneading to make.

      – Jocelyn and I have made this I think almost every time we have had friends over to our

      is completely trivial to make and invariably completely delicious.
