          <p><b>Hello!</b>
          <p>Good evening! Please take up a chair; I will bring you some hot chocolate in a moment.
             Feel free to browse.
          <p>
            This is the website of me, Alan Rempel. I am a student at the 
            <a href="https://ukings.ca" title="University of King's College | Halifax, Nova Scotia">University of King's College</a> 
            (Halifax, NS), as well as a chorister there. I am fond of tea and wool sweaters.
            I like programming in <a href="https://haskell.org" title="The Haskell programming language">Haskell</a>, especially when I have
            no spare time in which to do so.
          <p>This website consists, at the moment, solely of my <em>blog</em>, which I update according as I
            have spare time and whim. It is displayed in full below.

            <p>I have started using a paper notebook for an agenda/planner/to-do-list thing,
              and I find it works for me much better than any of the various electronic,
              computer-based solutions that I have tried! Partly this is because the computer
              continually offers me distractions, ways of getting wrapped up in <em>computing</em>,
              when all I actually need to do is jot down what I have to do today. Paper and pen
              are less intrinsically exciting. A specific case of this: I can waste all kinds of time
              <em>configuring</em> whatever computer tool I use, but there is no such thing as that
              with the paper notebook, because the act of “configuring” it and the act of using it
              are one: both consist in writing lines, symbols, and characters with the pen on the page.
              The configuration is done in exactly the same medium as the content. The reason this is 
              not so with computer-based tools is that, while writing prose on a computer is the easiest
              thing in the world, organizing that prose <em>visually</em> – as one wants to do when one
              is making an agenda (a section for each day of the week, say) – is much more cumbersome.
              The obvious solution is to automate it – create a template for the desired layout (in the
              form of HTML or org-mode or whatever one wishes) – but this introduces brittleness, and the
              necessity of the dreaded <em>configuration</em>. There's no way around it. That said, some
              computer-based task-management or calendar-management tools are actually very very good – but
              they cost at least as much as my notebook did, and I have more confidence that my notebook
              will be useful to me – for a long time and in a variety of contexts – than any piece of software.

            <p>
              I wanted to write a new blog post tonight, but when I re-rendered the site and had a look at
              it, I was perplexed to find that all my posts were gone! I checked my ‘posts’ folder, and
              indeed, I had apparently somehow deleted them all. I may have a means of recovering them; I'll
              have to investigate further.
            <p>But how is it, you ask, that you can still see all my posts in the very flesh, sitting just below this one?
              The answer is this: I write my posts in a different format than that in which they are provided to your web browser;
              I deleted those original files that I wrote myself, but I had already compiled them into the hypertext files that
              the web browser reads, and so all the posts still exist in that format (namely, the 
              <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" title="HTML Standard"><i>HyperText Markup Language</i></a>).
            <p>The upshot, then, is that nothing has changed
              you, the reader of this blog, but for me, its author, the blog is considerably more awkward to edit and update.
              For that reason, I will probably no longer have an ‘All Posts’ page separate from the home page, since I now have to
              copy and paste post titles between the two pages to keep them in sync.
              (But then again, a little copy-and-pasting is good for the soul …)

            <p>
              More or less on a whim, I purchased the domain <code>threedots.ca</code>
              tonight and pointed it to this website. Thus you can now
              access this website at <a href="http://threedots.ca/">http://threedots.ca/</a>, which is
              considerably shorter and more memorable than
              <a href="https://threedots.neocities.org/">https://threedots.neocities.org/</a>. Three Dots will continue
              to be available at the latter domain for the foreseeable
              future. The nice thing about <code>threedots.ca</code>, though, is that
              I can continue to point that to my website no matter where I
              host it—as opposed to <code>threedots.neocities.org</code> or
              <code>threedots.github.io</code>, which contains the name of the hosting
              provider, and in fact they control the domain.

              While I was sitting in the café this morning, I saw a bus
              rolling sure-wheeledly down Oxford street – on its
              electronic displays, instead of a route number, it said
              “STUFF A BUS”. I was mightily perplexed …

about airplanes. Travelling
by airplane is essentially a form of teleportation, in that
it involves travelling from a starting point to a
destination without traversing any of the intervening
places. One does traverse some kind of intervening <em>space</em>
(namely, some part of the atmosphere), but this is not humanly
habitable space – not space that has the <em>capacity</em> to
contain places.—What then of mid-journey airport layovers? Well,
airports tend to be placeless, or un-placed, or deprived of
place-context, or only-quasi-places, in a different sense:
they are typically very poorly connected to the urban fabric
of the city which they serve.</p>

          They turned out re­ally well! It’s a very soft and sticky
          dough, and the cook­ies ex­panded dur­ing bak­ing quite a bit
          more than I an­tic­i­pated. The re­sult is not ac­tu­ally such a
          rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent cookie than you might sup­pose from the
          typ­i­cal choco­late chip cookie;—the tahini just adds a
          lovely nutty and slightly bit­ter shade, with­out chang­ing the
          tex­ture much. Will def­i­nitely make again.

    While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
    friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
    was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
    “Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
    longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
    center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
    remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
    right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.
