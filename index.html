<p><em>(But Alan,—what is your plan?)</em></p>
<p><strong>—I will tell you my plan.</strong></p>
<p><em>(Will you tell us your plan?)</em></p>
<p><strong>Here is my plan. My plan is as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Walk for fifteen minutes, absorb sun, engender
endorphins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrive at the Lucky Penny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out the rest of the plan. (It will involve writing
beautiful code, because that is my job.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>—What do you think of my plan?</strong></p>
<p><em>(It is a very fine plan, I suppose. I like the bit about
the endorphins.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<p><em>(But don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a touch vague? So much is left in
the realm of contingency …)</em></p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s a plan for a plan, you fool! Isn&#39;t that obvious? It
is entirely in accordance with my established <em>modus
operandi</em>.</strong></p>
<p><em>(Very well, then. I shall leave you to it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>—Very well indeed, then! Off thus I go!</strong></p>
<p><em>(Off indeed you go!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Yes indeed:—off I go!</strong></p>

different sorts of task: you would therefore think that a
person would approach then very differently. Everyone has a
different way of cleaning their room and a different way of
writing a paper; at the very least, though, you can safely
assume that cleaning one&#39;s room is the easier and less
daunting of the two tasks. Cleaning one&#39;s room therefore
ought to be anticipated by less, if any, of the anxiety,
procrastination, etc., that often leads up to writing a
paper.—Well, as it turns out, if we replace the abstract
“one” with the concrete “Alan”, then the above conjecture no
longer holds. It seems that, for him, the intent to clean
his room provokes at least as much anxiety and use of
various avoidance strategies (among which outright
procrastination is actually only a last resort!), as does
writing any of even the longest and thorniest papers of his
undergraduate degree. Again the mystery of Why Does Alan Do
Things rears its head.</p>
<p>(Between ourselves, I think the problem in both cases is
that I didn&#39;t know where to start or how to feel like I&#39;m
making progress. And didn&#39;t really want to do the
thinking—planning, imagining—that would have answered
these questions. Which thinking turned out to be not hard
and to trivially solve my problem! I feel kind of silly
about that, but what can you do.)</p>

living room. It was a lot of fun–it felt long overdue. It
made me think of a note I had written to myself, dated 5
March 2017, just after getting back from a party on L—–
street. It was the sort of party where eventually, sometime
after midnight, those who remained at that point regrouped
in the kitchen: someone put on music, a few did the dishes,
and the rest danced. An excerpt from that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about academics. Whatever is necessary
that such dance parties as that one
should happen again—that&#39;s what matters to me. That
everybody should be able to dance with their
friends in a safe and comfortable space and know this and
enjoy it and have lots of fun, knowing that they are among
friends—that is what is most worthwhile to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I suppose scholarship is worthwhile too. Generally
speaking I do think there are other things worthwhile
besides dance parties. For example, sleeping, scaling rocky
slopes, eating grass, etc. Blogging, I&#39;m not so sure about;
but here we are.</p>

<p>They turned out really well! It&#39;s a very soft and sticky
dough, and the cookies expanded during baking quite a bit
more than I anticipated. The result is not actually such a
radically different cookie than you might suppose from the
typical chocolate chip cookie;—the tahini just adds a
lovely nutty and slightly bitter shade, without changing the
texture much. Will definitely make again.</p>

So what am I doing? It&#39;s 1:30am: what exactly do I like
about being awake at night? For I&#39;ve been staying up well
past midnight at least once a week these days.—But I think
the answer is this: it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m guaranteed
solitude without going out of my way to find it. It&#39;s easy
enough to find a place without anyone I know around; it&#39;s
harder to find a place without people at all. And then
further a place that is comfortable, that one knows and
knows how to inhabit:—one&#39;s own home at night. (—I.e.
after everyone else who&#39;s halfway sane has gone to
bed!).</p>
<p>(—That&#39;s a plausible explanation, but it may not be true.
The problem of why I do things remains, in general,
unsolved, and is the subject of ongoing research.)</p>

<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied; they asked, as though it followed
naturally,—Are you married?—No, I said.—Why not? they
said. You&#39;re twenty years old, you&#39;re tall, you have long
and luscious hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of
‘luscious’, I don&#39;t remember): what are you waiting for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no particular hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life occupying my attention,
and that——Nonsense, they said. Here&#39;s what you should
do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say, “Hello!
My name is”–what&#39;s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My
name is Alan! Do you want to get married?”—Wouldn&#39;t that
seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the
one.—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you
see, give her some flowers, and then she&#39;ll like you and ask
<em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>

compelled to offer an explanation for why I was alternating smooth skating with
bouts of stumbling: “Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I&#39;m no
longer in the zone! But it&#39;s okay, I just take a moment to center myself and get
back in the groove.” One of my friends thought this remark expressed something
about my essence. That&#39;s probably true. Though I now think that my real problem
was that my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
