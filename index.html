<p>I often feel that I do not know what I want. <em>However,</em> I
have begun to suspect that, when I (otherwise inexplicably)
fail to do something—it was because I did not want to do
it.</p>
<p>Therefore: I had better pay attention to what I want, wish,
value, delight in, because I will not succeed in carrying
