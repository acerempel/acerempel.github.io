          <p>Good evening! Please take up a chair; I will bring you some sparkling water in a moment.
Feel free to browse.</p>
<p>This is the website of me, Alan Rempel. I am a student at the
<a href="https://ukings.ca" title="University of King's College | Halifax, Nova Scotia">University of King's College</a> (Halifax, NS).
I am fond of tea and wool sweaters.
I like programming in <a href="https://haskell.org" title="The Haskell programming language">Haskell</a>, especially when I have
no spare time in which to do so. You may find me on Instagram as
<a href="https://instagram.com/alan_rempel_mdash/">@alan_rempel_mdash</a> and on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/acerempel">@acerempel</a>.</p>
<p>Currently this website consists of my <a href="#blog"><b>blog</b></a>, which I update according as I
have spare time and whim, and some <a href="#miscellaneous"><b>miscellaneous lists</b></a>.</p>

              Please accept my apologies for the disappeared posts! I have taken apart my website and am in the process of putting it back together.
              I hope to get all the posts back up again soon.

              <p>I was bored this afternoon, so I ate a raw clove of garlic.</p>
<p>That’s all.</p>

              <p>While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
