          <p><b>Hello!</b>
          <p>Good evening! Please take up a chair; I will bring you some hot chocolate in a moment.
             Feel free to browse.
          <p>
            This is the website of me, Alan Rempel. I am a student at the 
            <a href="https://ukings.ca" title="University of King's College | Halifax, Nova Scotia">University of King's College</a> 
            (Halifax, NS), as well as a chorister there. I am fond of tea and wool sweaters.
            I like programming in <a href="https://haskell.org" title="The Haskell programming language">Haskell</a>, especially when I have
            no spare time in which to do so.
          <p>This website consists, at the moment, solely of my <em>blog</em>, which I update according as I
            have spare time and whim. It is displayed in full below.

            <p>My friend Samuel once pointed out to me<br>that I am entirely unlike the Senior Common Room—<br>
              in that I am neither <em>senior</em>,—nor <em>common</em>,————————<br>

              The other day, it was just warm enough outside (i.e., a couple degrees above zero) that we could open the
              windows a bit in our apartment—‘could’?—I mean, warm enough that it felt refreshing rather than frigid—in any case,
              Jocelyn opened a window, and it did feel marvellous refreshing. It was quite nice.

              Today it is chillier outside; I drank a glass of sparkling water mixed with grapefruit juice and with an ice cube made of coffee.

              I wanted to write a new blog post tonight, but when I re-rendered the site and had a look at
              it, I was perplexed to find that all my posts were gone! I checked my ‘posts’ folder, and
              indeed, I had apparently somehow deleted them all. I may have a means of recovering them; I'll
              have to investigate further.

              More or less on a whim, I purchased the domain <code>threedots.ca</code>
              tonight and pointed it to this website. Thus you can now
              access this website at <a href="http://threedots.ca/">http://threedots.ca/</a>, which is
              considerably shorter and more memorable than
              <a href="https://threedots.neocities.org/">https://threedots.neocities.org/</a>. Three Dots will continue
              to be available at the latter domain for the foreseeable
              future. The nice thing about <code>threedots.ca</code>, though, is that
              I can continue to point that to my website no matter where I
              host it—as opposed to <code>threedots.neocities.org</code> or
              <code>threedots.github.io</code>, which contains the name of the hosting
              provider, and in fact they control the domain.

              While I was sitting in the café this morning, I saw a bus
              rolling sure-wheeledly down Oxford street – on its
              electronic displays, instead of a route number, it said
              “STUFF A BUS”. I was mightily perplexed …

about airplanes. Travelling
by airplane is essentially a form of teleportation, in that
it involves travelling from a starting point to a
destination without traversing any of the intervening
places. One does traverse some kind of intervening <em>space</em>
(namely, some part of the atmosphere), but this is not humanly
habitable space – not space that has the <em>capacity</em> to
contain places.—What then of mid-journey airport layovers? Well,
airports tend to be placeless, or un-placed, or deprived of
place-context, or only-quasi-places, in a different sense:
they are typically very poorly connected to the urban fabric
of the city which they serve.</p>

          They turned out re­ally well! It’s a very soft and sticky
          dough, and the cook­ies ex­panded dur­ing bak­ing quite a bit
          more than I an­tic­i­pated. The re­sult is not ac­tu­ally such a
          rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent cookie than you might sup­pose from the
          typ­i­cal choco­late chip cookie;—the tahini just adds a
          lovely nutty and slightly bit­ter shade, with­out chang­ing the
          tex­ture much. Will def­i­nitely make again.

    While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
    friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
    was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
    “Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
    longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
    center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
    remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
    right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.
