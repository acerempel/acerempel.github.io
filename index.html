sorts of task: you would therefore think that a person would
approach then very differently. Everyone has a different way
of cleaning their room and a different way of writing a paper;
at the very least, though, you can safely assume that cleaning
one&#39;s room is the easier and less daunting of the two tasks.
Cleaning one&#39;s room therefore ought to be anticipated by less,
if any, of the stress, procrastination, etc., that often leads
up to writing a paper.—Well, as it turns out, if we replace
the abstract “one” with the concrete “Alan”, then the above
conjecture no longer holds. It seems that, for him, the intent
to clean his room provokes at least as much anxiety, sadness,
use of various avoidance strategies (among which outright
procrastination is actually only a last resort!), as does
writing any of even the longest and thorniest papers of his
undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Alan. This is my blog.—A strange sort of blog, since
it has no readers. Is a blog a blog without
readers?—Perhaps. It may not remain without readers
forever—I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll want to continue
writing posts knowing that there&#39;s no one reading them.
(Although the blog is live (at the time of writing) at
https://parsonyorick.github.io/, I haven&#39;t told anyone the
url. And it seems to be reasonably difficult to find on
Google—if Google has indexed it at all.) After all, it&#39;s
surely for the sake of being read that a blog exists—this
seems to be what distinguishes a blog from a private
journal. Or is a journal made into a blog by virtue of being
hosted on the web? For my purposes at the moment, this
doesn&#39;t matter: the upshot seems to be that this is either a
goofy little blog or a goofy little not-really-a-blog, in
which I write whatever I want, and I have a little more
motivation to edit and perfect my writing because I can sort
of pretend it&#39;s published. That&#39;s all it is for the moment.
Purely a private instrument of vainglory.</p>

living room. It was a lot of fun— it felt long overdue. It
made me think of a note I had written to myself, dated 5
March 2017, just after getting back from a party on L–––
street. It was the sort of party that eventually, sometime
after midnight, morphed into a dance party in the kitchen:
someone put on music, a few did the dishes, the rest danced.
An excerpt from that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about academics or philosophy or theology or
truth. Whatever is necessary that such dance parties as that one
should happen again—that&#39;s what matters to me. That everybody in
the world should be able to dance it down with their friends in a
safe and comfortable and happy space and know this and love it,
knowing that they are among friends—that is what is most
worthwhile to me.</p>

<p>They turned out really well! It&#39;s a very soft and sticky
dough, and the cookies expanded during baking quite a bit
more than I anticipated. The result is not actually such a
radically different cookie from the typical chocolate chip
than you might suppose;—the tahini just adds a lovely
nutty and slightly bitter shade, without changing the
texture much.</p>

I doing? What exactly do I like about being awake at night?
For I stay up well past midnight at least once a week these
days.—But I think the answer is this: it&#39;s the only time
I&#39;m guaranteed solitude without going out of my way to find
it. It&#39;s easy enough to find a place without anyone I know
around; it&#39;s harder to find a place without people at all.
And then further a place that is comfortable, that one knows
and knows how to inhabit:—one&#39;s own home at night.
(—I.e. after everyone else who&#39;s halfway sane has gone to
bed!).</p>

dad had always done it for him—I can&#39;t imagine because he
wasn&#39;t capable of booking a flight himself or was daunted by
the thought or something, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a father might do for a son.—Like landing his son a
job at a web development firm!—Yes, I gather next year he
wants to secure his own employment. He was saying he was
actually daunted by the thought of applying for jobs, resumes,
interviews, etc., so doing all that independently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>

<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied, and they asked in turn, as though it just followed
naturally,—Are you married?—No, I said.—Why not?
You&#39;re twenty years old, you&#39;re tall, you have long and
luscious hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of
‘luscious’, I don&#39;t remember): what are you waiting for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no particular hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life occupying my attention,
and that in any case—Nonsense, they said. Here&#39;s what you
should do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say,
“Hello! My name is—”–what&#39;s your name,
again?—Alan.—“Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get
married?”— Wouldn&#39;t that seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I
guess so, said the one—Hey! said the other, no, do this:
The next girl you see, give her some flowers, and then
she&#39;ll like you and ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I
liked this plan better.</p>

friends—S— was tracing me and giving me pointers—I was
alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling. I
offered an explanation: “Sometimes I just space out for a
moment and then suddenly I&#39;m no longer in the zone! But it&#39;s
okay, I just take a moment to center myself and get back in
the groove.” S— thought this especially typical of me.</p>
