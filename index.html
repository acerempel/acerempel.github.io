Fr. Curran second-guess himself, and his sermon ended up questionably
coherent—though quite amusing!</p>

happens, this is the first flight in his life he&#39;s booked for
himself — struck me as remarkable. I guess in the past his
dad had always done it for him—I can&#39;t imagine because he
wasn&#39;t capable of booking a flight himself or was daunted by
the thought or something, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a father might do for a son.—Like landing his son a
job at a web development firm!—Yes, I gather next year he
wants to secure his own employment. He was saying he was
actually daunted by the thought of applying for jobs, resumes,
interviews, etc., so doing all that independently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>

<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture —but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies;—so we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was. I answered that I
was twenty years old, and in reply they asked, as though,
given my response, it was the most natural question in the
world,—Are you married? No—I said.—Why not? You&#39;re
twenty years old, you&#39;re tall, you have long and luscious
hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of ‘luscious’, I
don&#39;t remember): what are you waiting for? I told them that
I felt I was in no particular rush, I have so many other
things in my life occupying my attention, and in any
case—Nonsense, they said. Here&#39;s what you should do. The
next girl you see, you go up to her and say, “Hello! My name
is—”–what&#39;s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My name
is Alan! Do you want to get married?”— Wouldn&#39;t that seem
a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the one—Hey! said
the other, no, do this: The next girl you see, give her some
flowers, and then she&#39;ll like you and ask <em>you</em> to marry
<em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>
