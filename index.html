<p>It took me a while after I arrived in Winnipeg to start feeling lonely. I

<p>Not exactly toute de suite, though. I have to</p>

<li><p>Come up with a concrete rationale for returning to Hfx sooner than

<p>Oh my goodness I am so bored here you would not believe. I have to escape.
I escaped from Halifax; time to escape from Winnipeg and complete the cycle.</p>

happens, this is the first flight in his life he's booked for
himself --- struck me as remarkable. I guess in the past his
dad had always done it for him---I can't imagine because he
wasn't capable of booking a flight himself or was daunted by
the thought or something, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a father might do for a son.---Like landing his son a
job at a web development firm!---Yes, I gather next year he
wants to secure his own employment. He was saying he was
actually daunted by the thought of applying for jobs, resumes,
interviews, etc., so doing all that independently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>

across a tree that that had a face---eyes, a nose and a mouth
affixed to its bark. As I paused to admire it and take a
picture I was accosted by a couple of kids who were hanging
out in the yard of the house to my left. Someone wiser than me
might have been content with saying hi and casually
proceeding on their way: as for me, being accosted by children
happens to number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up
a conversation. They asked me how old I was, and when I
answered that I was twenty years old, the obvious question,
apparently, was---was I married. No---I said. Why not? they
said. You're twenty years old, you're tall, you have long and
luscious hair (perhaps they said 'flowing' instead of
'luscious', I don't remember): what are you waiting for? I
told them that I felt I was in no particular rush, I have so
many things in my life occupying my attention, and in any
case---Nonsense, they said. The next girl you see, you go up
to her and say, “Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get
married?” Wouldn't that seem a bit abrupt? I said. I guess so,
said the one---Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl
you see, give her some flowers, and then she'll like you and
ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>
