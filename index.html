I am fond of tea and wool sweaters.

              <p>This city is a strange place—so much of it is paved.</p>
<p>The trees here—it must be lonely for them, not being in a
forest; stretching their roots out and finding soil
compacted by cement, soil sparse of arboreal conversation.</p>

              <p>While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
