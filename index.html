<p>There was the method of kneel­ing,<br>
a ﬁne method, if you lived in a coun­try<br>
where stones were smooth.<br>
The women dreamed wist­fully of bleached court­yards,<br>
hidden cor­ners where knee ﬁt rock.<br>
Their prayers were weath­ered rib bones,<br>
small cal­cium words ut­tered in se­quence,<br>
as if this shed­ding of syl­la­bles could some­how<br>
fuse them to the sky.</p>
<p>There were the men who had been shep­herds so long<br>
they walked like sheep.<br>
Under the olive trees, they raised their arms—<br>
Hear us! We have pain on earth!<br>
We have so much pain there is no place to store it!<br>
But the olives bobbed peace­fully<br>
in fra­grant buck­ets of vine­gar and thyme.<br>
At night the men ate heartily, ﬂat bread and white cheese,<br>
and were happy in spite of the pain,<br>
because there was also hap­pi­ness.\</p>
<p>Some prized the pil­grim­age,<br>
wrapping them­selves in new white linen<br>
to ride buses across miles of va­cant sand.<br>
When they ar­rived at Mecca<br>
they would cir­cle the holy places,<br>
on foot, many times,<br>
they would bend to kiss the earth<br>
and re­turn, their lean faces hous­ing mys­tery.\</p>
<p>While for cer­tain cousins and grand­moth­ers<br>
the pil­grim­age oc­curred daily,<br>
lugging wa­ter from the spring<br>
or bal­anc­ing the bas­kets of grapes.<br>
These were the ones pre­sent at births,<br>
humming qui­etly to per­spir­ing moth­ers.<br>
The ones stitch­ing in­tri­cate needle­work into chil­dren’s dresses,<br>
forgetting how eas­ily chil­dren soil clothes.\</p>
<p>There were those who did­n’t care about pray­ing.<br>
The young ones. The ones who had been to America.<br>
They told the old ones, you are wast­ing your time.<br>
Time?—The old ones prayed for the young ones.<br>
They prayed for Allah to mend their brains,<br>
for the twig, the round moon,<br>
to speak sud­denly in a com­mand­ing tone.\</p>
<p>And oc­ca­sion­ally there would be one<br>
who did none of this,<br>
the old man Fowzi, for ex­am­ple, Fowzi the fool,<br>
who beat every­one at domi­noes,<br>
insisted he spoke with God as he spoke with goats,<br>
and was fa­mous for his laugh.\</p>

dif­fer­ent sorts of task: you would there­fore think that a
per­son would ap­proach then very dif­fer­ently. Everyone has a
dif­fer­ent way of clean­ing their room and a dif­fer­ent way of
writ­ing a pa­per; at the very least, though, you can safely
as­sume that clean­ing one’s room is the eas­ier and less
daunt­ing of the two tasks. Cleaning one’s room there­fore
ought to be an­tic­i­pated by less, if any, of the anx­i­ety,
pro­cras­ti­na­tion, etc., that of­ten leads up to writ­ing a
pa­per.—Well, as it turns out, if we re­place the ab­stract
“one” with the con­crete<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Alan”, then the above con­jec­ture no
longer holds. It seems that, for him, the in­tent to clean
his room pro­vokes at least as much anx­i­ety and use of
var­i­ous avoid­ance strate­gies (among which out­right
pro­cras­ti­na­tion is ac­tu­ally only a last re­sort!), as does
writ­ing any of even the longest and thorni­est pa­pers of his
un­der­grad­u­ate de­gree. Again the mys­tery of Why Does Alan Do
Things rears its head.</p>
<p>(Between our­selves, I think the prob­lem in both cases is
that I did­n’t know where to start or how to feel like I’m
making progress. And did­n’t re­ally want to do the
think­ing—plan­ning, imag­in­ing—that would have an­swered
these ques­tions. Which think­ing turned out to be not hard
and to triv­ially solve my prob­lem! I feel kind of silly
about that, but what can you do.)</p>

liv­ing room. It was a lot of fun–it felt long over­due. It
made me think of a note I had writ­ten to my­self, dated 5
March 2017, just af­ter get­ting back from a party on L—–
street. It was the sort of party where even­tu­ally, some­time
af­ter mid­night, those who re­mained at that point re­grouped
in the kitchen: some­one put on mu­sic, a few did the dishes,
and the rest danced. An ex­cerpt from that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t re­ally care about aca­d­e­mics. Whatever is nec­es­sary
that such dance par­ties as that one
should hap­pen again—that’s what mat­ters to me. That
everybody should be able to dance with their
friends in a safe and com­fort­able space and know this and
en­joy it and have lots of fun, know­ing that they are among
friends—that is what is most worth­while to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I sup­pose schol­ar­ship is worth­while too. Generally
speaking I do think there are other things worth­while
be­sides dance par­ties. For ex­am­ple, sleep­ing, scal­ing rocky
slopes, eat­ing grass, etc. Blogging, I’m not so sure about;
but here we are.</p>

<p>They turned out re­ally well! It’s a very soft and sticky

So what am I do­ing? It’s 1:30am: what ex­actly do I like

past mid­night at least once a week these days.—But I think
the an­swer is this: it’s the only time I’m guar­an­teed

enough to ﬁnd a place with­out any­one I know around; it’s
harder to ﬁnd a place with­out peo­ple at all. And then
fur­ther a place that is com­fort­able, that one knows and

after every­one else who’s halfway sane has gone to

<p>As I was walk­ing down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth af­ﬁxed to its bark. I paused to ad­mire it and take a
pic­ture—but at this point I was ac­costed by a cou­ple of
chil­dren who were hang­ing out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, be­ing ac­costed by chil­dren hap­pens to
num­ber among my favourite hob­bies. So we struck up a
con­ver­sa­tion. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied; they asked, as though it fol­lowed
nat­u­rally,—Are you mar­ried?—No, I said.—Why not? they
said. You’re twenty years old, you’re tall, you have long
and lus­cious hair (perhaps they said<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ﬂowing’ in­stead of
‘lus­cious’, I don’t re­mem­ber): what are you wait­ing for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no par­tic­u­lar hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life oc­cu­py­ing my at­ten­tion,
and that——Non­sense, they said. Here’s what you should
do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Hello!
My name is”–what’s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My
name is Alan! Do you want to get mar­ried?”—Would­n’t that
seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the
one.—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you
see, give her some ﬂow­ers, and then she’ll like you and ask
<em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!<span class="small-caps">—I</span> told them I liked this plan bet­ter.</p>
