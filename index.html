tonight and pointed it to this website. Thus you can now
access this website at <a href="http://threedots.ca/">http://threedots.ca/</a>, which is
considerably shorter and more memorable than
<a href="https://threedots.neocities.org/">https://threedots.neocities.org/</a>. Three Dots will continue
to be available at the latter domain for the foreseeable
future. The nice thing about <code>threedots.ca</code>, though, is that
I can continue to point that to my website no matter where I
host it—as opposed to <code>threedots.neocities.org</code> or
<code>threedots.github.io</code>, which contains the name of the hosting
provider, and in fact they control the domain.</p>

<p>I often feel that I do not know what I want. <em>However,</em> I
have begun to suspect that, when I (otherwise inexplicably)
fail to do something—it was because I did not want to do
it.</p>
<p>Therefore: I had better pay attention to what I want, wish,
value, delight in, because I will not succeed in carrying
through to completion anything else!</p>
