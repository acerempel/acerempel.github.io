          <p>I am Alan; this is my website.

          have spare time and whim, some <a href="/#miscellaneous"><b>miscellaneous lists</b></a>. There is also
          a page with a little more <a href="/introduction"><b>about</b></a> this website and me.

              <h3><a href="/posts/transit/">On transit</a></h3>
              <p>I think about public transit a lot. I think it's really important, and I
am very interested in how it can be made better.</p>
<p>I've realized recently that the <em>activity</em> of riding public
transit, on the other hand, does, in general, not bring me joy.

              <h3><a href="/posts/rideau-canal/">The Rideau Canal</a></h3>
              
<p>
As of <time datetime="2020-06-11">June 11th</time>, the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa is the nearest body of water to where I live.
Previously it was the Atlantic Ocean; before that, the Assiniboine
River—both natural bodies of water:——but the Rideau Canal is an
artificial one.

              <h3><a href="/posts/jocelyn/">Jocelyn</a></h3>
              <p>I first met my fiancée on <time datetime="2017-05-04">May 4th,
2017</time>. I found my record of this incident as I was reading through
my <span class="smallcaps">Catalogue of Days</span>, looking for potential blog-post material. (I knew
that we had met in May of that year, but I had forgot the exact date.)
At the time, among my housemates was a good high-school friend of hers,
so she was visiting for a week and stayed with us. I described her in
that entry as <q>pretty cool</q>. (I now have more developed thoughts on
her virtues.)</p>
