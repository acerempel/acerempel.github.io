<li><p>The voiceover recording session with Ted went rather well
--- he was quite pleased. It was neat hearing my own voice
through the headphones recorded at such high quality and
amplified --- it really is different from listening to a
voice memo I recorded on my phone. Fact, I kinda want one
of those Zoom thingamies!</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of types from the Canadian Red Cross came to the
door this afternoon and spoke with me in such a way that
now I have signed up to donate $30 monthly, it's all
rather a blur, in order to resist I would have had to
summon a certain kind of presence of mind that I have not
had since Tuesday, not to mention powers of
rationalization --- the way they were talking about it,
I'd feel like a bad citizen if I refused too curtly or
without an eminently sound reason. And they were very
professional --- the two of them, one who introduced
himself first and did most of the talking on the phone to
head office, and the other, the supervisor, who did most
of the talking with me and was also training the other one
as he went. And they have all these lovely procedures and
iPads and so forth. They processed me with admirable
efficiency.</p>
<p>In any case, the upshot is I can't buy a bagel and a cup
of coffee every other day at the Galley anymore. I'll have
to channel Emma's thrift.</p></li>
<li><p>Also Sally came over with Bella who is staying the night
with us while the Ito-Dycks are at the Morden corn and
apple festival.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven't done any work today --- not a single GitHub
comment, not a single --- well, in fact several lines of
code, but none of them very important, just to do with my
personal obsession with rewriting the ItemManager. Which
really ought to be done, but I don't know if Itamar would
think it a priority. For a month and a half all the
programming instincts in me have been crying out for the
ItemManager to be rewritten --- it's my last chance, soon
enough I'm off --- the timebox won't permit it --- I could
ask Itamar --- ah, he'll just say no --- maybe not --- but
I'm doing it! there's no stopping me! --- well.</p></li>

Halifax. What's more, I have to <em>actually</em> DO them --- it
turns out --- I can't just think about doing them and imagine
they're pretty well done, or (what I apparently have been
doing more and more lately) not think about doing them and not
imagine them done and pretend they don't exist.</p>
<p>Right. So what are these alleged THINGS that I have to
~~allegedly~~ actually DO, again?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Call the CRA, ask if they happen to have processed my 2014
tax return, or why the heck not, in any case persuade them
to tell their computers I exist.</p>
<p>This is easy. Would take like half an hour. The only trick
is to do it while they have folks answering the phone. So,
today, before 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Email Penny. Urgent! This thing deserves more discussion
elsewhere. I'm just not sure what to tell her, though,
because this only works if I actually have money, which at
the moment I don't. Hence---</p></li>
<li><p>Reply to Vicky's text. I would <em>like</em> to say yes, your
brother can stay in my room, it's the <em>sort</em> of thing I
would say, it would be gracious of me, but then it would
have been really gracious of me (to myself and to my
flatmates) to keep the room in a habitable state. So ---
what? I guess I say, I'd like to say yes but I can't in
good conscience recommend it? That sounds weird. I dunno.</p></li>
<li><p>Compose budget.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask Dad/Grandpa for more money.</p></li>
<li><p>Check if we have gotten paid, by any chance.</p>
<p>a. Email Crosstown that they should let me into my online
banking account again and also their security mechanism
is dumb.</p>
<p>b. Walk over to Crosstown, get account balance by way of
the ATM.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It took me a while after I arrived in Winnipeg to start feeling lonely. I
figured I would at some point. I should return---</p>
<p>Not exactly toute de suite, though. I have to</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Arrange to visit Kenji at Pioneer camp. Principally this involves emailing
Graham.</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with a concrete rationale for returning to Hfx sooner than
my family has been expecting. CR choir camp maybe? Madeleine? Inquire
about Madeline!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Oh my goodness I am so bored here you would not believe. I have to escape.
I escaped from Halifax; time to escape from Winnipeg and complete the cycle.</p>

happens, this is the first flight in his life he's booked for
himself --- struck me as remarkable. I guess in the past his
dad had always done it for him---I can't imagine because he
wasn't capable of booking a flight himself or was daunted by
the thought or something, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a father might do for a son.---Like landing his son a
job at a web development firm!---Yes, I gather next year he
wants to secure his own employment. He was saying he was
actually daunted by the thought of applying for jobs, resumes,
interviews, etc., so doing all that independently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>

across a tree that that had a face---eyes, a nose and a mouth
affixed to its bark. As I paused to admire it and take a
picture I was accosted by a couple of kids who were hanging
out in the yard of the house to my left. Someone wiser than me
might have been content with saying hi and casually
proceeding on their way: as for me, being accosted by children
happens to number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up
a conversation. They asked me how old I was, and when I
answered that I was twenty years old, the obvious question,
apparently, was---was I married. No---I said. Why not? they
said. You're twenty years old, you're tall, you have long and
luscious hair (perhaps they said 'flowing' instead of
'luscious', I don't remember): what are you waiting for? I
told them that I felt I was in no particular rush, I have so
many things in my life occupying my attention, and in any
case---Nonsense, they said. The next girl you see, you go up
to her and say, “Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get
married?” Wouldn't that seem a bit abrupt? I said. I guess so,
said the one---Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl
you see, give her some flowers, and then she'll like you and
ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>
