<p>I’m Alan. This is my blog.—A strange sort of blog, since
it has no read­ers. Is a blog a blog with­out
read­ers?—Per­haps. It may not re­main with­out read­ers
for­ever—I don’t know how long I’ll want to con­tinue
writ­ing posts know­ing that there’s no one read­ing them.
(Al­though the blog is live (at the time of writ­ing) at
https://​par­son­y­orick.github.io/, I haven’t told any­one the
url. And it seems to be rea­son­ably dif­ﬁ­cult to ﬁnd on
Google—if Google has in­dexed it at all.) After all, it’s
surely for the sake of be­ing read that a blog ex­ists—this
seems to be what dis­tin­guishes a blog from a pri­vate
jour­nal. Or is a jour­nal made into a blog by virtue of be­ing
hosted on the web? For my pur­poses at the mo­ment, this
does­n’t mat­ter: the up­shot seems to be that this is ei­ther a
goofy lit­tle blog or a goofy lit­tle not-re­ally-a-blog, in
which I write what­ever I want, and I have a lit­tle more
mo­ti­va­tion to edit and per­fect my writ­ing be­cause I can sort
of pre­tend it’s pub­lished. That’s all it is for the mo­ment.
Purely a pri­vate in­stru­ment of vain­glory.</p>
