<p>I&#39;m Alan. This is my blog.—A strange sort of blog, since
it has no readers. Is a blog a blog without
readers?—Perhaps. It may not remain without readers
forever—I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll want to continue
writing posts knowing that there&#39;s no one reading them.
(Although the blog is live (at the time of writing) at
https://parsonyorick.github.io/, I haven&#39;t told anyone the
url. And it seems to be reasonably difficult to find on
Google—if Google has indexed it at all.) After all, it&#39;s
surely for the sake of being read that a blog exists—this
seems to be what distinguishes a blog from a private
journal. Or is a journal made into a blog by virtue of being
hosted on the web? For my purposes at the moment, this
doesn&#39;t matter: the upshot seems to be that this is either a
goofy little blog or a goofy little not-really-a-blog, in
which I write whatever I want, and I have a little more
motivation to edit and perfect my writing because I can sort
of pretend it&#39;s published. That&#39;s all it is for the moment.
Purely a private instrument of vainglory.</p>
