      <div class="e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I find it weird how frequently government expenses are casually
referred to as “taxpayer dollars” or costs to taxpayers—when in fact
the dollars that the Canadian federal government spends need not come
from taxpayers.<!-- FOLD --></p>
<p>Common parlance certainly has it otherwise. Ex.
“The extension of the light rail line is expected to cost
taxpayers about $3 billion”; or, remarking upon a government expense
that one sees as imprudent or frivolous, “So <em>that’s</em> what my tax dollars
are going towards!” To me, these turns of phrase suggest that most people think</p>
<ul>
<li>that the money that
governments spend comes from the taxes its citizens and corporations
pay; and</li>
<li>that, as democratic
institutions, governments should be held accountable to their
(tax-paying) citizens in respect of their expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, calling government money ‘taxpayer dollars’ or similar is a
way of asserting <em>ownership</em> of it, so to speak. ‘It's really <em>our</em>
money.’</p>
<p>Politically speaking, this is a perfectly democratic sentiment. I think
it gets a lot of its force, though, from the idea that the government
<em>needs our money</em> in order to fund its expenses. Which is not
necessarily true, depending on which level of government you are talking
about.</p>
<p>The federal government, in particular, <strong>does not depend on revenue</strong> in
order to spend money. This is because its (domestic) expenses are in
Canadian dollars, and it also is the <em>issuer</em> of Canadian dollars. It is
not like us wage-earners who have to get dollars from somewhere
else before we can spend them. City and provincial governments too need
to get their dollars from taxes, borrowing, or federal grants: only the
federal government has the currency-issuing power.</p>
<p>For the same reason, there are no financial limits on how many Canadian
dollars the federal government can borrow. The idea of a goverment
‘borrowing’ in the currency that it alone issues is a bit weird anyway.
One can hardly call that a debt-obligation.</p>
<p>This is just a fact about currency-issuing national governments like
that of Canada. That it is a controversial and poorly-known fact
testifies to the weirdness of modern economic discourse. I really only
understood it relatively recently.</p>
<p>There are certainly many other ways besides talking about “taxpayer
dollars” in which the media, economists, politicians, and the general
public perpetuate the idea that the federal government is constrained by
revenue or by limits on how much it can borrow. But “taxpayer dollars”
seems to me to be the most pervasive.</p>

the magnitude federal deficit does not matter, and related topics, see
