As it
happens, this is the first flight in his life he&#39;s booked for
himself --- struck me as remarkable. I guess in the past his
dad had always done it for him---I can&#39;t imagine because he
wasn&#39;t capable of booking a flight himself or was daunted by
the thought or something, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a father might do for a son.---Like landing his son a
job at a web development firm!---Yes, I gather next year he
wants to secure his own employment. He was saying he was
actually daunted by the thought of applying for jobs, resumes,
interviews, etc., so doing all that independently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>
