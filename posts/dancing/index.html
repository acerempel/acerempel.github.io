(short—i.e. only one song) in the living room. It was a lot of
fun—the more so because it felt long overdue—not for any specific
reason, but mainly because this was something we had done as house
with some frequency last year but which had this year kind of
fallen by the wayside. But it was lovely. It made me think of a
note I had written to myself, dated 5 March 2017, just after
getting back from a party on Lawrence street. It was the sort of
party where eventually—sometime after midnight—those of us who
were still there retreated into the kitchen: someone put on music,
a few did the dishes, others danced (the latter two swapping out
from time to time). An excerpt from said note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a good thing going with so-and-so earlier, when it was just
the two of us dancing in the Lawrence street kitchen—I was mainly imitating
her moves, we were in sync, we were grooving it!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about academics or philosophy or theology or
truth. Whatever is necessary that such dance parties as that one
should happen again—that&#39;s what matters to me. That everybody in
the world should be able to dance it down with their friends in a
safe and comfortable and happy space and know this and love it,
knowing that they are among friends—that is what is most
worthwhile to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably imagine that I, reconsidering the thing soberly, would like at the
very least to heavily qualify the statement that I “don&#39;t really care about
academics or philosophy or theology or truth”.—Which, well, yes and no. I think
dancing has more to contribute to philosophy than philosophy has to dancing;
and dancing really does attain closer than academic work and thinky-thinking do to
the end to which both of them—for me—are directed. And independent of my
relative valuations of dancing and brain-work, I think dancing together can be
compared with eating together (and—for that matter—singing together—but that&#39;s
another post) as experiences of human togetherness.</p>
