by Pink) dance party with Emma and Katy, I thought of a note I wrote to myself
on 5 March 2017, just after getting back from a party on Lawrence St. where
eventually—sometime after midnight—those of us who remained retreated into
the kitchen and put on music, some doing the dishes, others dancing. Below, an
excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a good thing going with so-and-so earlier, when it was just the two of
us dancing in the Lawrence street kitchen—I was mainly imitating her moves,
we were in sync, we were grooving it!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about academics or philosophy or theology or truth.
Whatever is necessary that such dance parties as that one should happen
again—that&#39;s what matters to me. That everybody in the world should be able
to dance it down with their friends in a safe and comfortable and happy space
and know this and love it, knowing that they are among friends—that is what
is most worthwhile to me.</p>
