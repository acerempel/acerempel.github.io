liv­ing room. It was a lot of fun–it felt long over­due. It
made me think of a note I had writ­ten to my­self, dated 5
March 2017, just af­ter get­ting back from a party on L—–
street. It was the sort of party where even­tu­ally, some­time
af­ter mid­night, those who re­mained at that point re­grouped
in the kitchen: some­one put on mu­sic, a few did the dishes,
and the rest danced. An ex­cerpt from that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t re­ally care about aca­d­e­mics. Whatever is nec­es­sary
that such dance par­ties as that one
should hap­pen again—that’s what mat­ters to me. That
everybody should be able to dance with their
friends in a safe and com­fort­able space and know this and
en­joy it and have lots of fun, know­ing that they are among
friends—that is what is most worth­while to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I sup­pose schol­ar­ship is worth­while too. Generally
speaking I do think there are other things worth­while
be­sides dance par­ties. For ex­am­ple, sleep­ing, scal­ing rocky
slopes, eat­ing grass, etc. Blogging, I’m not so sure about;
but here we are.</p>
