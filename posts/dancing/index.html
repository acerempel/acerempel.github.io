living room. It was a lot of fun–it felt long overdue. It
made me think of a note I had written to myself, dated 5
March 2017, just after getting back from a party on L—–
street. It was the sort of party where eventually, sometime
after midnight, those who remained at that point regrouped
in the kitchen: someone put on music, a few did the dishes,
and the rest danced. An excerpt from that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about academics. Whatever is necessary
that such dance parties as that one
should happen again—that&#39;s what matters to me. That
everybody should be able to dance with their
friends in a safe and comfortable space and know this and
enjoy it and have lots of fun, knowing that they are among
friends—that is what is most worthwhile to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I suppose scholarship is worthwhile too. Generally
speaking I do think there are other things worthwhile
besides dance parties. For example, sleeping, scaling rocky
slopes, eating grass, etc. Blogging, I&#39;m not so sure about;
but here we are.</p>
