C—&#39;s sermon this morning was even more scattered and
apologetic than usual—he was going to talk about
Machiavelli, but he made the mistake, he told us, of telling
this to the barista as he was getting his coffee that
morning, who said something that made Fr. C— second-guess
himself; and, per usual, his sermon ended up a much more
rambling and amusing creature than he had intended. It&#39;s
almost a shame, these things always seem to happen to him
just at the last minute—he&#39;s spent days preparing something
admirably cogent and insightful, and then disaster strikes!</p>
