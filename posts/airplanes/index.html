<p>I was thinking about what is place and what is placeless, because
I was in a class this summer on the History
of the Marine Sciences, and in one lecture the professor
told us about a theory of the modern scientific laboratory
as a ‘placeless place’. I forget precisely what was the justification of
this claim. I think the idea was that modern laboratories are designed to facilitate
the same experiments and produce the same results no matter where the
its environment and no matter its place-context. A laboratory might be
on the tenth floor of a building in the city of Ottawa, it might be on a
ship of the coast of Labrador – for the science, it's not supposed to
matter. Moreover laboratories these days do not I think have internal
characteristics that make being in one like being in a different place
compared to being in another.

<p>This idea of placelessness made me think of airplanes, and, to a
lesser degree, automobiles.
I thought of how travelling
by airplane feels like a kind of teleportation, because you go from one place
to another without traversing any of the intervening
places. One does traverse some kind of intervening <em>space</em>
(namely, some part of the atmosphere), but this is not humanly
habitable space – not space that has the <em>capacity</em> to
contain places.
