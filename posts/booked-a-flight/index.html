As it
hap­pens, this is the ﬁrst ﬂight in his life he’s booked for
him­self — struck me as re­mark­able. I guess in the past his
dad had al­ways done it for him—I can’t imag­ine be­cause he
was­n’t ca­pa­ble of book­ing a ﬂight him­self or was daunted by
the thought or some­thing, but just as a sort of favour, a nice
thing a fa­ther might do for a son.—Like land­ing his son a
job at a web de­vel­op­ment ﬁrm!—Yes, I gather next year he
wants to se­cure his own em­ploy­ment. He was say­ing he was
ac­tu­ally daunted by the thought of ap­ply­ing for jobs, re­sumes,
in­ter­views, etc., so do­ing all that in­de­pen­dently would be
even more a point of pride for him.</p>
