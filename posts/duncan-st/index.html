<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied, and they asked in turn, as though it just followed
naturally, it was the most natural question in the
world,—Are you married?—No, I said.—Why not? You&#39;re
twenty years old, you&#39;re tall, you have long and luscious
hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of ‘luscious’, I
don&#39;t remember): what are you waiting for?—I told them
that I felt I was in no particular hurry to get married,
that I have so many other things in my life occupying my
attention, and that in any case—Nonsense, they said.
Here&#39;s what you should do. The next girl you see, you go up
to her and say, “Hello! My name is—”–what&#39;s your name,
again?—Alan.—“Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get
married?”— Wouldn&#39;t that seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I
guess so, said the one—Hey! said the other, no, do this:
The next girl you see, give her some flowers, and then
she&#39;ll like you and ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I
liked this plan better.</p>
