<p>As I was walk­ing down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth af­ﬁxed to its bark. I paused to ad­mire it and take a
pic­ture—but at this point I was ac­costed by a cou­ple of
chil­dren who were hang­ing out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, be­ing ac­costed by chil­dren hap­pens to
num­ber among my favourite hob­bies. So we struck up a
con­ver­sa­tion. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied; they asked, as though it fol­lowed
nat­u­rally,—Are you mar­ried?—No, I said.—Why not? they
said. You’re twenty years old, you’re tall, you have long
and lus­cious hair (perhaps they said<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ﬂowing’ in­stead of
‘lus­cious’, I don’t re­mem­ber): what are you wait­ing for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no par­tic­u­lar hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life oc­cu­py­ing my at­ten­tion,
and that——Non­sense, they said. Here’s what you should
do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Hello!
My name is”–what’s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My
name is Alan! Do you want to get mar­ried?”—Would­n’t that
seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the
one.—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you
see, give her some ﬂow­ers, and then she’ll like you and ask
<em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!<span class="small-caps">—I</span> told them I liked this plan bet­ter.</p>
