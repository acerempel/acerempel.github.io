compelled to offer an explanation for why I was alternating smooth skating with
bouts of stumbling: “Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I&#39;m no
longer in the zone! But it&#39;s okay, I just take a moment to center myself and get
back in the groove.” One of my friends thought this remark expressed something
about my essence. That&#39;s probably true. Though I now think that my real problem
was that my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
