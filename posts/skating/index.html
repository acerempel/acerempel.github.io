com­pelled to of­fer an ex­pla­na­tion for why I was al­ter­nat­ing smooth skat­ing with
bouts of stum­bling:<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Sometimes I space out for a mo­ment and sud­denly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a mo­ment to cen­ter my­self and get
back in the groove.” One of my friends thought this re­mark ex­pressed some­thing
about my essence. That’s prob­a­bly true. Though I now think that my real prob­lem
was that my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
