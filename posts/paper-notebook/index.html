          <p>
              I have started using a paper notebook for an agenda/planner/to-do-list thing,
              and I find it works better for me than any of the various
              computer-based solutions that I have tried. I tend to waste all kinds of time
              <em>configuring</em> whatever computer program I use, but there is no such thing as that
              with the paper notebook, because “configuring” it and using it
              are one: both of these consist in writing lines, symbols, and characters with the pen on the page.
              You create the scaffolding the same way you create the content. This is
              not so with computer-based tools because, while writing prose on a computer is very easy –
              a computer even has special hardware designed for it –
              organizing that prose <em>visually</em> – as one wants to do when one
              is making an agenda (a section of the page for each day of the week, for example) – is vastly more cumbersome.
              Some computer-based task-management or calendar-management tools are actually very good – but
              they cost at least as much as my notebook did, and I have more confidence that my notebook
              will be useful to me, for a long time and in a variety of contexts, than any piece of software.
