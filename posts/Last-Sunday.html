As I paused to admire it and take a picture I was accosted by a couple of kids who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my left. Someone wiser than me might have contented themself with saying hi and casually proceeding on their way: as for me, being accosted by children happens to number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a conversation. They asked me how old I was, and when I answered that I was twenty years old, the obvious question, apparnently, was—was I married. No—I said. Why not? they said. You’re twenty years old, you’re tall, you have long and luscious hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of ‘luscious’, I don’t remember): what are you waiting for? I told them that I felt I was in no particular rush, I have so many things in my life occupying my attention, and in any case—Nonsense, they said. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say, “Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get married?” Wouldn’t that seem a bit abrupt? I said. I guess so, said the one—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you see, give her some flowers, and then she’ll like you and ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>! I liked this plan better.</p></article></main><footer>Alan Rempel © 2017<a href="https://parsonyorick.github.io/blog">Source</a></footer></body></html>
