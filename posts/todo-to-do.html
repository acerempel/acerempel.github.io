Halifax. What's more, I have to <em>actually</em> DO them --- it
turns out --- I can't just think about doing them and imagine
they're pretty well done, or (what I apparently have been
doing more and more lately) not think about doing them and not
imagine them done and pretend they don't exist.</p>
<p>Right. So what are these alleged THINGS that I have to
~~allegedly~~ actually DO, again?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Call the CRA, ask if they happen to have processed my 2014
tax return, or why the heck not, in any case persuade them
to tell their computers I exist.</p>
<p>This is easy. Would take like half an hour. The only trick
is to do it while they have folks answering the phone. So,
today, before 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Email Penny. Urgent! This thing deserves more discussion
elsewhere. I'm just not sure what to tell her, though,
because this only works if I actually have money, which at
the moment I don't. Hence---</p></li>
<li><p>Reply to Vicky's text. I would <em>like</em> to say yes, your
brother can stay in my room, it's the <em>sort</em> of thing I
would say, it would be gracious of me, but then it would
have been really gracious of me (to myself and to my
flatmates) to keep the room in a habitable state. So ---
what? I guess I say, I'd like to say yes but I can't in
good conscience recommend it? That sounds weird. I dunno.</p></li>
<li><p>Compose budget.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask Dad/Grandpa for more money.</p></li>
<li><p>Check if we have gotten paid, by any chance.</p>
<p>a. Email Crosstown that they should let me into my online
banking account again and also their security mechanism
is dumb.</p>
<p>b. Walk over to Crosstown, get account balance by way of
the ATM.</p></li>
</ol>
