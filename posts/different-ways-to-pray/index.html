<blockquote>
<p><span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">There was the method of kneeling,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">a fine method, if you lived in a country where stones were smooth.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">The women dreamed wistfully of bleached courtyards,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 1em">hidden corners where knee fit rock.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">Their prayers were weathered rib bones,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">small calcium words uttered in sequence,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">as if this shedding of syllables could somehow</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">fuse them to the sky.</span><br>
</p><p>There were the men who had been shepherds so long<br>
they walked like sheep.<br>
Under the olive trees, they raised their arms—<br>
Hear us! We have pain on earth!<br>
We have so much pain there is no place to store it!<br>
But the olives bobbed peacefully<br>
in fragrant buckets of vinegar and thyme.<br>
At night the men ate heartily, flat bread and white cheese,<br>
and were happy in spite of the pain,<br>
because there was also happiness.</p>
<p>Some prized the pilgrimage,<br>
wrapping themselves in new white linen<br>
to ride buses across miles of vacant sand.<br>
When they arrived at Mecca<br>
they would circle the holy places,<br>
on foot, many times,<br>
they would bend to kiss the earth<br>
and return, their lean faces housing mystery.</p>
<p>While for certain cousins and grandmothers<br>
the pilgrimage occurred daily,<br>
lugging water from the spring<br>
or balancing the baskets of grapes.<br>
These were the ones present at births,<br>
humming quietly to perspiring mothers.<br>
The ones stitching intricate needlework into children’s dresses,<br>
forgetting how easily children soil clothes.</p>
<p><span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">There were those who didn’t care about praying.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">The young ones. The ones who had been to America.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">They told the old ones, you are wasting your time.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 1em">Time?—The old ones prayed for the young ones.</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">They prayed for Allah to mend their brains,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">for the twig, the round moon,</span><br>
<span style="margin-inline-start: 0em">to speak suddenly in a commanding tone.</span><br>
</p><p>And occasionally there would be one<br>
who did none of this,<br>
the old man Fowzi, for example, Fowzi the fool,<br>
who beat everyone at dominoes,<br>
insisted he spoke with God as he spoke with goats,<br>
and was famous for his laugh.</p>
