<p>There was the method of kneel­ing,<br>
a ﬁne method, if you lived in a coun­try<br>
where stones were smooth.<br>
The women dreamed wist­fully of bleached court­yards,<br>
hidden cor­ners where knee ﬁt rock.<br>
Their prayers were weath­ered rib bones,<br>
small cal­cium words ut­tered in se­quence,<br>
as if this shed­ding of syl­la­bles could some­how<br>
fuse them to the sky.</p>
<p>There were the men who had been shep­herds so long<br>
they walked like sheep.<br>
Under the olive trees, they raised their arms—<br>
Hear us! We have pain on earth!<br>
We have so much pain there is no place to store it!<br>
But the olives bobbed peace­fully<br>
in fra­grant buck­ets of vine­gar and thyme.<br>
At night the men ate heartily, ﬂat bread and white cheese,<br>
and were happy in spite of the pain,<br>
because there was also hap­pi­ness.\</p>
<p>Some prized the pil­grim­age,<br>
wrapping them­selves in new white linen<br>
to ride buses across miles of va­cant sand.<br>
When they ar­rived at Mecca<br>
they would cir­cle the holy places,<br>
on foot, many times,<br>
they would bend to kiss the earth<br>
and re­turn, their lean faces hous­ing mys­tery.\</p>
<p>While for cer­tain cousins and grand­moth­ers<br>
the pil­grim­age oc­curred daily,<br>
lugging wa­ter from the spring<br>
or bal­anc­ing the bas­kets of grapes.<br>
These were the ones pre­sent at births,<br>
humming qui­etly to per­spir­ing moth­ers.<br>
The ones stitch­ing in­tri­cate needle­work into chil­dren’s dresses,<br>
forgetting how eas­ily chil­dren soil clothes.\</p>
<p>There were those who did­n’t care about pray­ing.<br>
The young ones. The ones who had been to America.<br>
They told the old ones, you are wast­ing your time.<br>
Time?—The old ones prayed for the young ones.<br>
They prayed for Allah to mend their brains,<br>
for the twig, the round moon,<br>
to speak sud­denly in a com­mand­ing tone.\</p>
<p>And oc­ca­sion­ally there would be one<br>
who did none of this,<br>
the old man Fowzi, for ex­am­ple, Fowzi the fool,<br>
who beat every­one at domi­noes,<br>
insisted he spoke with God as he spoke with goats,<br>
and was fa­mous for his laugh.\</p>
