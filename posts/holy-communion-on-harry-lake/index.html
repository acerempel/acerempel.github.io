      </header>
      <p>At this year’s Fall Retreat at Mersey River Chalets, Holy
Communion on the lake took place at 7:00 am, which was later
than in the past – last year I think it was at 6:45. The
temperature had dropped below zero overnight, so the grass
and the leaves upon it were frosty, and there was a thin
layer of ice on the lake, and mist drifting over it. It was
quite beautiful.</p>
<p>I had printed leaflets containing the order of worship and
the music for the service, including English Gradual set to
plainchant and hymns. To illuminate these – for it was still
dark outside (although already a little lighter than at 5:30
am, when I had my vigil slot) – we each had a beeswax taper.
I was holding my taper and leaflet in the same hand, in
order to keep my other hand in my pocket for warmth,
alternating hands every few minutes.</p>
<p>While we were singing the Nicene Creed, my friend Sophia,
who was standing beside me, pointed out to me that my
service leaflet was on fire. We both tried to blow it out,
but to no avail – the fire just got bigger. As it was
becoming apparent that my hand would soon get burned if I
did not relinquish the paper, someone – it may have been
Alison, who was standing on my other side – suggested,
either by word or by gesture, I forget, that I drop it on
the ground and stomp the fire out. I did so, and the fire
was rapidly extinguished.</p>
