much easier state to be in. So what am I doing? What exactly
do I like about being awake at night? For I stay up well past
midnight at least once a week these days.—But I think the
answer is this: it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m guaranteed solitude
without going out of my way to find it. It&#39;s easy enough to
find a place without anyone I know around—it&#39;s harder to find
a place without people at all. And then further a place that
is comfortable, that one can be in knowing that one has the
right to be there, that is, a place that one knows and
habitually inhabits:—one&#39;s own home at night. (—I.e. after
everyone else who&#39;s sane has gone to bed!).</p>
<p>(The above excerpted from the most recent of <em>three</em> journal
entries from within the past three weeks which each contain
some form of the question—‘Why am I awake?’ I wonder
whether I might be advised to dial this habit back a bit.)</p>
