So what am I doing? It&#39;s 1:30am: what exactly do I like
about being awake at night? For I&#39;ve been staying up well
past midnight at least once a week these days.—But I think
the answer is this: it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m guaranteed
solitude without going out of my way to find it. It&#39;s easy
enough to find a place without anyone I know around; it&#39;s
harder to find a place without people at all. And then
further a place that is comfortable, that one knows and
knows how to inhabit:—one&#39;s own home at night. (—I.e.
after everyone else who&#39;s halfway sane has gone to
bed!).</p>
<p>(—That&#39;s a plausible explanation, but it may not be true.
The problem of why I do things remains, in general,
unsolved, and is the subject of ongoing research.)</p>
