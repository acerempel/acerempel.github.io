So what am
I doing? What exactly do I like about being awake at night?
For I stay up well past midnight at least once a week these
days.—But I think the answer is this: it&#39;s the only time
I&#39;m guaranteed solitude without going out of my way to find
it. It&#39;s easy enough to find a place without anyone I know
around; it&#39;s harder to find a place without people at all.
And then further a place that is comfortable, that one knows
and knows how to inhabit:—one&#39;s own home at night.
(—I.e. after everyone else who&#39;s halfway sane has gone to
bed!).</p>
