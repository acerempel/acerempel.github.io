              <p>I have a great love of <em>editing</em>. Semicolon—<br>or m-dash? Too many syllables? Too languid?<br>too clipped? One sentence twisting, another<br>straight-ahead. Warp; point; zig; zag. I once<br>dropped my house-keys such that they fell<br>between the boards of the front porch:<br> I rescued them
with a bent coat-hanger. Yes,<br> I am nothing if not resourceful.</p>

              <p>Yesterday evening we had friends over to our apartment for our weekly
oomancy session. As I was sweeping the floor in anticipation of their
arrival, I thought back to the first time I tried my hand at oomancy.

<p>
As of <time datetime="2020-06-11">June 11th</time>, the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa is the nearest body of water to where I live.
Previously it was the Atlantic Ocean; before that, the Assiniboine
River—both natural bodies of water:——but the Rideau Canal is an
artificial one.

              <p>This city is a strange place—so much of it is paved.</p>
<p>The trees here—it must be lonely for them, not being in a
forest; stretching their roots out and finding soil
compacted by cement, soil sparse of arboreal conversation.</p>
