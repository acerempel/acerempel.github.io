              <p>I am very fond of public transit. I think about it a lot. I think it's
really important; I want it to become better, and I often contemplate
ways of improving it in whatever city I am living in. Why is that?

<p>
As of <time datetime="2020-06-11">June 11th</time>, the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa is the nearest body of water to where I live.
Previously it was the Atlantic Ocean; before that, the Assiniboine
River—both natural bodies of water:——but the Rideau Canal is an
artificial one.

              <p>I first met my fiancée on <time datetime="2017-05-04">May 4th,
2017</time>. I found my record of this incident as I was reading through
my <span class="smallcaps">Catalogue of Days</span>, looking for potential blog-post material. (I knew
that we had met in May of that year, but I had forgot the exact date.)
At the time, among my housemates was a good high-school friend of hers,
so she was visiting for a week and stayed with us. I described her in
that entry as <q>pretty cool</q>. (I now have more developed thoughts on
her virtues.)</p>

              <p>This city is a strange place—so much of it is paved.</p>
<p>The trees here—it must be lonely for them, not being in a
forest; stretching their roots out and finding soil
compacted by cement, soil sparse of arboreal conversation.</p>

<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies.

              <p>While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
