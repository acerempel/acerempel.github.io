            I wanted to write a new blog post tonight, but when I re-rendered the site and had a look at
            it, I was perplexed to find that all my posts were gone! I checked my ‘posts’ folder, and
            indeed, I had apparently somehow deleted them all. I may have a means of recovering them; I'll
            have to investigate further. There's no need to fear; only the sources files are gone, the
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files that constitute the rendered and published
            site are entirely intact.—In fact, I am writing this very post by editing the HTML file for the
            homepage of the site directly. (I will have to copy and paste it into the ‘All Posts’ page, but no
            matter—a little copy-and-pasting is good for the soul.)

          </h2><p>More or less on a whim, I purchased the domain <code>threedots.ca</code>
tonight and pointed it to this website. Thus you can now
access this website at <a href="http://threedots.ca/">http://threedots.ca/</a>, which is
considerably shorter and more memorable than
<a href="https://threedots.neocities.org/">https://threedots.neocities.org/</a>. Three Dots will continue
to be available at the latter domain for the foreseeable
future. The nice thing about <code>threedots.ca</code>, though, is that
I can continue to point that to my website no matter where I
host it—as opposed to <code>threedots.neocities.org</code> or
<code>threedots.github.io</code>, which contains the name of the hosting
provider, and in fact they control the domain.</p>

<p>I often feel that I do not know what I want. <em>However,</em> I
have begun to suspect that, when I (otherwise inexplicably)
fail to do something—it was because I did not want to do
it.</p>
<p>Therefore: I had better pay attention to what I want, wish,
value, delight in, because I will not succeed in carrying
through to completion anything else!</p>

It is
probably the second or third easiest recipe for a nourishing
and delicious supper that I have ever made. And it only uses
ingredients that I virtually always have in my cupboard!</p>
<p>(Part of the trick is that it has you cook the pasta <em>in</em>
the sauce. This is a technique Deb Perelman has advocated for
before, I believe.)</p>

about airplanes. Travelling
by airplane is essentially a form of teleportation, in that
it involves travelling from a starting point to a
destination without traversing any of the intervening
places. One does traverse some kind of intervening <em>space</em>
(namely, some part of the atmosphere), but this is not humanly
habitable space – not space that has the <em>capacity</em> to
contain places.—What then of mid-journey airport layovers? Well,
airports tend to be placeless, or un-placed, or deprived of
place-context, or only-quasi-places, in a different sense:
they are typically very poorly connected to the urban fabric
of the city which they serve.</p>

friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.</p>
