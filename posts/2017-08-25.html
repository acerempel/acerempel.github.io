<li><p>The voiceover recording session with Ted went rather well
--- he was quite pleased. It was neat hearing my own voice
through the headphones recorded at such high quality and
amplified --- it really is different from listening to a
voice memo I recorded on my phone. Fact, I kinda want one
of those Zoom thingamies!</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of types from the Canadian Red Cross came to the
door this afternoon and spoke with me in such a way that
now I have signed up to donate $30 monthly, it's all
rather a blur, in order to resist I would have had to
summon a certain kind of presence of mind that I have not
had since Tuesday, not to mention powers of
rationalization --- the way they were talking about it,
I'd feel like a bad citizen if I refused too curtly or
without an eminently sound reason. And they were very
professional --- the two of them, one who introduced
himself first and did most of the talking on the phone to
head office, and the other, the supervisor, who did most
of the talking with me and was also training the other one
as he went. And they have all these lovely procedures and
iPads and so forth. They processed me with admirable
efficiency.</p>
<p>In any case, the upshot is I can't buy a bagel and a cup
of coffee every other day at the Galley anymore. I'll have
to channel Emma's thrift.</p></li>
<li><p>Also Sally came over with Bella who is staying the night
with us while the Ito-Dycks are at the Morden corn and
apple festival.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven't done any work today --- not a single GitHub
comment, not a single --- well, in fact several lines of
code, but none of them very important, just to do with my
personal obsession with rewriting the ItemManager. Which
really ought to be done, but I don't know if Itamar would
think it a priority. For a month and a half all the
programming instincts in me have been crying out for the
ItemManager to be rewritten --- it's my last chance, soon
enough I'm off --- the timebox won't permit it --- I could
ask Itamar --- ah, he'll just say no --- maybe not --- but
I'm doing it! there's no stopping me! --- well.</p></li>
