    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first met my fiancée on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2017-05-04&quot;&gt;May 4th,
2017&lt;/time&gt;. I found my record of this incident as I was reading through
my Catalogue of Days, looking for potential blog-post material. (I knew
that we had met in May of that year, but I had forgot the exact date.)
At the time, among my housemates was a good high-school friend of hers,
so she was visiting for a week and stayed with us. I described her in
that entry as &lt;q&gt;pretty cool&lt;/q&gt;. (I now have more developed thoughts on
her virtues.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>I muse upon the excellences of paper notebooks, as opposed to electronic programs designed for comparable purposes.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have started using a paper notebook for an agenda/planner/to-do-list
thing. It&#39;s been an interesting experiment. &lt;!-- FOLD --&gt; I notice that I tend to waste all kinds of time
&lt;em&gt;configuring&lt;/em&gt; whatever computer program I use, but there is no such thing as that
with the paper notebook, because “configuring” it and using it
are one: both of these consist in writing lines, symbols, and characters with the pen on the page.
You create the scaffolding the same way you create the content. This is
not so with computer-based tools because, while writing prose on a computer is very easy –
a computer even has special hardware designed for it –
organizing that prose &lt;em&gt;visually&lt;/em&gt; – as one wants to do when one
is making an agenda (a section of the page for each day of the week, for example) – is vastly more cumbersome.
Some computer-based task-management or calendar-management tools are actually very good – but
they cost at least as much as my notebook did, and I have more confidence that my notebook
will be useful to me, for a long time and in a variety of contexts, than any piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;

forest; stretching their roots out and finding soil
compacted by cement, soil sparse of arboreal conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>In which it is cold, and there is mist over the lake, and I set my service leaflet on fire.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At this year’s Fall Retreat at Mersey River Chalets, Holy
Communion on the lake took place at 7:00 am, which was later
than in the past – last year I think it was at 6:45. The
temperature had dropped below zero overnight, so the grass
and the leaves upon it were frosty, and there was a thin
layer of ice on the lake, and mist drifting over it. It was
quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had printed leaflets containing the order of worship and
the music for the service, including English Gradual set to
plainchant and hymns. To illuminate these – for it was still
dark outside (although already a little lighter than at 5:30
am, when I had my vigil slot) – we each had a beeswax taper.
I was holding my taper and leaflet in the same hand, in
order to keep my other hand in my pocket for warmth,
alternating hands every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were singing the Nicene Creed, my friend Sophia,
who was standing beside me, pointed out to me that my
service leaflet was on fire. We both tried to blow it out,
but to no avail – the fire just got bigger. As it was
becoming apparent that my hand would soon get burned if I
did not relinquish the paper, someone – it may have been
Alison, who was standing on my other side – suggested,
either by word or by gesture, I forget, that I drop it on
the ground and stomp the fire out. I did so, and the fire
was rapidly extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My to-do list</title>

    <summary>It is an extremely secret list, but only in respect of being a list.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a secret to-do list. The problem with my secret
to-do list, though, is that it’s easy for me to forget what
is on it. Because it’s not anywhere extant in
writing—that’s how secret it is. If it were recorded
anywhere outside my mind, it wouldn’t be so secret. Even if
were perfectly hidden from the eyes of others, I would
still know where it was and would be tempted to look at it.
So it would be a secret from all others, but not from me.
If it’s not written down, I can’t look at it, and so it can
be a secret from me too—just to the extent that I don’t
remember I have it. But this is the trouble, that in order
to preserve its secrecy, I don’t often call it to mind—or,
I sometimes call to mind individual items that happen to be
on the list, but not often in the context of the list, and
I very rarely think of the list as a whole. And the trouble
is that because of this, I run the risk of forgetting its
structure—and should I forget the structure of the list,
even if I remember, individually and not necessarily at the
same time, each of its items,—then the list is no longer.
Because it exists only in my mind, you see—there’s nothing
and no one else to testify to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Purple sparks</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to make purple sparks shoot from my
fingertips. I just had to snap my fingers at just the right
angle, with just the right force, when the humidity was just
right, when my hair was tied up in a bun in just the right
way …

&lt;!-- FOLD --&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t done that since about a year and a half ago now.
Am I still capable of it? I don’t know how to tell—short
of doing it again, of course. I haven’t even tried—why
not? I think I’m afraid of finding out for certain that I’ve
lost it. If I don’t even attempt it, then I can still
imagine that I have the power to do it. Then again, though,
even if I try it—having found the exact circumstances
under which I’ve always observed succeed—and fail, that
need not mean I’ve lost my purple sparks permanently.
Perhaps there is some other condition that needed to obtain
which I wasn’t aware of. Or perhaps the sparks will come
back in their own time.

    <summary>Eternal praise! eternal praise!</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago, after singing Compline across the lake,
after everyone else had dispersed, drifted back either to
the dining hall or to their own cabins: Nick Halley and I
standing on the edge of the frozen lake, looking out and
marveling, and resting alert and in awe, in the company of
the wind and of the snow and of the trees and of each other.
The clouds were moving swiftly across the sky—indistinct
in the darkness, but as they passed within a certain radius
of the moon their outlines were illuminated. The moon’s
light ebbed and grew stronger as clouds came and went in
front of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The river is &lt;em&gt;marvellous&lt;/em&gt;: louder than the wind, unceasing roaring,
a joyous clamour surging from the heart of the Kejimkujik
forest. ‘Eternal praise, eternal praise!’—singing with all
its might …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark. I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied; they asked, as though it followed
naturally,—Are you married?—No, I said.—Why not? they
said. You’re twenty years old, you’re tall, you have long
and luscious hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of
‘luscious’, I don’t remember): what are you waiting for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no particular hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life occupying my attention,
and that——Nonsense, they said. Here’s what you should
do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say, “Hello!
My name is”–what’s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My
name is Alan! Do you want to get married?”—Wouldn’t that
seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the
one.—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you
see, give her some flowers, and then she’ll like you and ask
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to marry &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;!—I told them I liked this plan better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and suddenly I’m no
longer in the zone! But it’s okay, I just take a moment to
center myself and get back in the groove.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right; also, I am sure my skates were not laced tightly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Setting off for Halifax; musing; killing time.</summary>
    <content type="html">      &lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find the security area was
virtually deserted. The kindly woman standing before the
queueing area touched the palms of my hands with the white
hemisphere on the end of a wand and said (having just seen
Paul hug me tight around in circles) how lovely it was to
see such a close-knit family and wished me a happy new year.
I had to show my boarding pass five times total, three of
those in the security area. I was the
only one in the x-ray line.—The security line staffperson: “No liquids, aerosols, gels,
toiletries, toothpaste, shaving cream, water
bottles?”—I: “No, those things are all in my checked bag.
Well, an empty water bottle.”—”Wait – empty? Does it have
any water in it?”—”No.”—”Okay, then.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s ten after eleven and they’re saying the plane
probably won’t arrive for fifteen minutes yet. Guess I’ll go
for another walk or something. The woman on the CBC news
says “we’re so consumeristic, a lot of the things still have
labels in them, the resale market shouldn’t be overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encounter a sign advertising a Chestnut Praline Latte at
Starbucks. I have nothing to do, and I am feeling
suggestible; I shall go to the Starbucks and purchase a
chestnut praline latte.—It tastes quite good – a lovely burnt-sugar flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
