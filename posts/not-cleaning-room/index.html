different sorts of task: you would therefore think that a
person would approach then very differently. Everyone has a
different way of cleaning their room and a different way of
writing a paper; at the very least, though, you can safely
assume that cleaning one&#39;s room is the easier and less
daunting of the two tasks. Cleaning one&#39;s room therefore
ought to be anticipated by less, if any, of the anxiety,
procrastination, etc., that often leads up to writing a
paper.—Well, as it turns out, if we replace the abstract
“one” with the concrete “Alan”, then the above conjecture no
longer holds. It seems that, for him, the intent to clean
his room provokes at least as much anxiety and use of
various avoidance strategies (among which outright
procrastination is actually only a last resort!), as does
writing any of even the longest and thorniest papers of his
undergraduate degree. Again the mystery of Why Does Alan Do
Things rears its head.</p>
<p>(Between ourselves, I think the problem in both cases is
that I didn&#39;t know where to start or how to feel like I&#39;m
making progress. And didn&#39;t really want to do the
thinking—planning, imagining—that would have answered
these questions. Which thinking turned out to be not hard
and to trivially solve my problem! I feel kind of silly
about that, but what can you do.)</p>
