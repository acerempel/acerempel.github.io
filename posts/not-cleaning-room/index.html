dif­fer­ent sorts of task: you would there­fore think that a
per­son would ap­proach then very dif­fer­ently. Everyone has a
dif­fer­ent way of clean­ing their room and a dif­fer­ent way of
writ­ing a pa­per; at the very least, though, you can safely
as­sume that clean­ing one’s room is the eas­ier and less
daunt­ing of the two tasks. Cleaning one’s room there­fore
ought to be an­tic­i­pated by less, if any, of the anx­i­ety,
pro­cras­ti­na­tion, etc., that of­ten leads up to writ­ing a
pa­per.—Well, as it turns out, if we re­place the ab­stract
“one” with the con­crete<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Alan”, then the above con­jec­ture no
longer holds. It seems that, for him, the in­tent to clean
his room pro­vokes at least as much anx­i­ety and use of
var­i­ous avoid­ance strate­gies (among which out­right
pro­cras­ti­na­tion is ac­tu­ally only a last re­sort!), as does
writ­ing any of even the longest and thorni­est pa­pers of his
un­der­grad­u­ate de­gree. Again the mys­tery of Why Does Alan Do
Things rears its head.</p>
<p>(Between our­selves, I think the prob­lem in both cases is
that I did­n’t know where to start or how to feel like I’m
making progress. And did­n’t re­ally want to do the
think­ing—plan­ning, imag­in­ing—that would have an­swered
these ques­tions. Which think­ing turned out to be not hard
and to triv­ially solve my prob­lem! I feel kind of silly
about that, but what can you do.)</p>
