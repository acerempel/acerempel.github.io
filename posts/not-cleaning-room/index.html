sorts of task: you would therefore think that a person would
approach then very differently. Everyone has a different way
of cleaning their room and a different way of writing a paper;
at the very least, though, you can safely assume that cleaning
one&#39;s room is the easier and less daunting of the two tasks.
Cleaning one&#39;s room therefore ought to be anticipated by less,
if any, of the stress, procrastination, etc., that often leads
up to writing a paper.—Well, as it turns out, if we replace
the abstract “one” with the concrete “Alan”, then the above
conjecture no longer holds. It seems that, for him, the intent
to clean his room provokes at least as much anxiety, sadness,
use of various avoidance strategies (among which outright
procrastination is actually only a last resort!), as does
writing any of even the longest and thorniest papers of his
undergraduate degree.</p>
