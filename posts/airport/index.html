            <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find the security area was
virtually deserted. The kindly woman standing before the
queueing area touched the palms of my hands with the white
hemisphere on the end of a wand and said (having just seen
Paul hug me tight around in circles) how lovely it was to
see such a close-knit family and wished me a happy new year.
I had to show my boarding pass five times total, three of
those in the security area. I was the
only one in the x-ray line.—The security line staffperson: “No liquids, aerosols, gels,
toiletries, toothpaste, shaving cream, water
bottles?”—I: “No, those things are all in my checked bag.
Well, an empty water bottle.”—”Wait – empty? Does it have
any water in it?”—”No.”—”Okay, then.”</p>
<p>Now it’s ten after eleven and they’re saying the plane
probably won’t arrive for fifteen minutes yet. Guess I’ll go
for another walk or something. The woman on the CBC news
says “we’re so consumeristic, a lot of the things still have
labels in them, the resale market shouldn’t be overlooked.”</p>
<p>I encounter a sign advertising a Chestnut Praline Latte at
Starbucks. I have nothing to do, and I am feeling
suggestible; I shall go to the Starbucks and purchase a
chestnut praline latte.—It tastes quite good – a lovely burnt-sugar flavour.</p>
