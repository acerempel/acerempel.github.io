As of <time datetime="2020-06-11">June 11th</time>, the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa is the nearest body of water to where I live.
Previously it was the Atlantic Ocean; before that, the Assiniboine
River—both natural bodies of water:——but the Rideau Canal is an
artificial one.<!-- FOLD --> In some respects, however, the canal seems to want to
imitate the riverhood of its namesake, yet it is patently a
different kind of being entirely. I want to say, for instance, that I have had picnics with
my friends on the bank of the canal, but in truth the
canal has no banks to speak of—just concrete walls bounding it on both sides, each with a
railing on top, and a paved path flush with the top of the wall.
The water is hardly a few inches below the top of the wall—and the soles of one's feet.
The canal therefore makes no pretense at having come into being in
concert with its surrounding landscape, as rivers do, e.g. by
gradually carving out a valley for itself.<!--% note 1 %--> On the other hand, it is lined on
each side
along much of its length with a sloping strip of narrow forest,
and beyond this, another paved path, and then a lawn several metres wide (this is what I have in mind when I want to say “we picnicked on the
bank of the canal”):——to me this tree-èd slope suggests aspirations towards
riverhood.<!-- note 2 %-->
It might even engender an illusion of riverhood, if one remains on the grassy area near the
upper path, on the other side of the trees. If, however, one
descends through the trees, down the concrete steps, to the canal-side
pathway, and sees the eerily flat water of the canal, then the illusion
is dissolved.
