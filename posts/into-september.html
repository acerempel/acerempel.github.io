<p>Alan has to be absolutely on top of the Shape Note Choir right
away. For one thing, leading the Shape Note Choir means he
will be responsible for part of the liturgy in the Friday
Evensong. For another, how fun and meaningful folks find shape
note singing at the Chapel will depend in part on the quality
of his direction and management of the choir. For a third,
this is a position constitutes an opportunity to him to be
excellent. Go beyond obligation and explore things like
possible collaboration with other a cappella groups in
Halifax, Harold Rennie and friends. (Apparently he knows
Sandra Bender! Not really a surprise.) Or a trip out to
Sackville---Fr. Ingalls mentioned he knows an expert on shape
notes out there. I'd advise him to take it up as his own and
make it something he can be proud of.</p>
<h2>Ancient Greek pedagogy.</h2>
<p>I don't know specifically. Keep hacking away at it. Talk with
Eli, Matthew, Grundke maybe. So far this is just a concept of
a personal project for him, not yet even an actual project,
and certainly not a responsibility (maybe he could see if he
can't make it into one? But who knows whether that will make
any sense --- see how it rolls). Keep reading---both secondary
material, linguistic and pedagogical, and actual ancient greek
texts!---throughout the summer, and we'll see where we're at
come September. I suppose he'd better take Intermediate Greek
in the fall --- will be too bad about John of Damascus, but
the time for the church fathers will come --- Greek is
actually necessary for his degree at the moment, besides being
of greater special interest to him.</p>
<h2>Household finances.</h2>
<p>Another gig that Alan can take up as his own and be excellent
in.</p>
<p>Haskell scripts to help with budgeting, figuring out who owes
what to who, applying a budget template for the week. Automate
or make it easy to turn the ledger file(s) into a spreadsheet,
charts. Alan could do this in Excel or, alternatively,
serialize the table/chart data and make the chart
programmatically, either in Haskell (which would mean we could
use hledger-lib directly, he wouldn't actually have to
serialize anything) or PureScript/Elm.</p>
<p>But also: habits. Reminding cats to put cash in the box.
Keeping careful track of who puts how much in each week,
filing receipts straightaway, etc. I should remind him to make
sure <em>every week</em> that the records are complete and
accurate---which will often involve asking cats how much they
spent on x, or whether they put cash in the box this week!</p>
<h2>Fun!</h2>
<p>I know he really enjoyed watching Scream Queens with Emma.
Maybe he could arrange to have a tv-watching friend again.</p>
