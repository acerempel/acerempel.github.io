across a tree that that had a face---eyes, a nose and a mouth
affixed to its bark. As I paused to admire it and take a
picture I was accosted by a couple of kids who were hanging
out in the yard of the house to my left. Someone wiser than me
might have been content with saying hi and casually
proceeding on their way: as for me, being accosted by children
happens to number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up
a conversation. They asked me how old I was, and when I
answered that I was twenty years old, the obvious question,
apparently, was---was I married. No---I said. Why not? they
said. You&#39;re twenty years old, you&#39;re tall, you have long and
luscious hair (perhaps they said &#39;flowing&#39; instead of
&#39;luscious&#39;, I don&#39;t remember): what are you waiting for? I
told them that I felt I was in no particular rush, I have so
many things in my life occupying my attention, and in any
case---Nonsense, they said. The next girl you see, you go up
to her and say, “Hello! My name is Alan! Do you want to get
married?” Wouldn&#39;t that seem a bit abrupt? I said. I guess so,
said the one---Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl
you see, give her some flowers, and then she&#39;ll like you and
ask <em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>
