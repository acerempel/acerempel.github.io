          <p>Hello! Welcome to my website!</p>
          <p>
            The only reason this
            website exists is that I find it enjoyable to work on it in
            my spare time (and even in time I have not to spare!). I also like experimenting
            with alternatives to the usual ways of presenting oneself in writing on the Internet. I have nothing
            against social media, though, and you may find me on Facebook and Instagram and maybe others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Why “three dots”?</b> Because three dots is the visual form of the ellipsis (‘…’), and
            I am often an elliptical man.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Concerning the blog:</b> I post highly irregularly.
            Posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
            their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
            when the post appears here—I often post backdated items that
            I had written as a note to myself much earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no commenting facility (yet), but if you send me an email
            commenting on a post, I might (with your permission) post
            your comment below the post.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Concerning how I made this website:</b> I used to write blog posts &amp;c. in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Markdown - Wikipedia">Markdown</a>
            and convert them into webpages using various iterations of programs I wrote for the purpose.
            Nowadays I just write <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> by hand, which is fun in its own way.
          <p>
            I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding, editing, removing stuff,
            adding stuff back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
            check back again soon!
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
            internet travels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yours,<br>
            Alan
          </p>
