          <p>Good evening! Please take up a chair; I will bring you some sparkling water in a moment.
Feel free to browse.</p>
<p>This is the website of me, Alan Rempel. I am a student at the
<a href="https://ukings.ca" title="University of King's College | Halifax, Nova Scotia">University of King's College</a> (Halifax, NS).
I am fond of tea and wool sweaters.
I like programming in <a href="https://haskell.org" title="The Haskell programming language">Haskell</a>, especially when I have
no spare time in which to do so. You may find me on Instagram as
<a href="https://instagram.com/alan_rempel_mdash/">@alan_rempel_mdash</a> and on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/acerempel">@acerempel</a>.</p>
<p>Currently this website consists of my <a href="/#blog"><b>blog</b></a>, which I update according as I
have spare time and whim, and some <a href="/#miscellaneous"><b>miscellaneous lists</b></a>.</p>

          <p>
            The only reason this
            website exists is that I find it enjoyable to work on it in
            my spare time (and even in time I have not to spare!). I also like experimenting
            with alternatives to the usual ways of presenting oneself in writing on the Internet. I have nothing
            against social media, though; I even post on Instagram occasionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Why “three dots”?</b> Because three dots is the visual form of the ellipsis (‘…’), and
            I am often an elliptical man.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Concerning the blog:</b> I post highly irregularly.
            Posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
            their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
            when the post appears here—I often post backdated items that
            I had written as a note to myself much earlier. In this sense, the blog is a sort
            of artificial construct: well—it is highly curated.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no commenting facility (yet), but if you send me an email
            commenting on a post, I might, with your permission post
            your comment below the post.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding, editing, removing stuff,
            adding stuff back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
            check back again soon!
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
            internet travels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yours,<br>
            Alan
          </p>
