Welcome!</p>
<p>I don’t really have much to say. The only reason this
website exists is that I find it enjoyable to work on it in
my spare time (and even in time I have not to spare!).</p>
<p>I tend not to imagine anyone reading what I write here (I
understand, though, that this is actually not the case—i.e.,
I believe that in reality two or possibly three people do
read this website at least sometimes), so I post highly
irregularly. Posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
when the post appears here—I often post backdated items that
I had written as a note to myself much earlier.</p>
<p>There are no comments (yet), but if you send me an email
commenting on a post, I might (with your permission) post
your comment below the post.</p>
<p>I am constantly adding posts, editing posts, removing posts,
adding them back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
check back again soon! (Someday I hope to have an RSS/Atom
feed, so you can simply subscribe, if you are old-school
like me and use an RSS reader. I have no plans for any kind
of social media integration.)</p>
<p>I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
internet travels.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Alan</p>
