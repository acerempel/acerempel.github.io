          <p>Hello! Welcome!</p>
          <p>
            I don’t really have much to say. The only reason this
            website exists is that I find it enjoyable to work on it in
            my spare time (and even in time I have not to spare!).
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend not to imagine anyone reading what I write here (though I realize this may not be the case), so I post highly
            irregularly. Posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
            their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
            when the post appears here—I often post backdated items that
            I had written as a note to myself much earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no comments (yet), but if you send me an email
            commenting on a post, I might (with your permission) post
            your comment below the post.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding posts, editing posts, removing posts,
            adding them back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
            check back again soon! (Someday I hope to have an RSS/Atom
            feed, so you can simply subscribe, if you are old-school
            like me and use an RSS reader. I have no plans for any kind
            of social media integration.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
            internet travels.
          </p>

            Yours,<br>
